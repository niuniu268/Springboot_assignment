## Aims

Based on the above image, I plan to design a couple of websites. This is the primary aim of this assignemt.  
![image8](https://github.com/niuniu268/Springboot_assignment/blob/master/Images/Screenshot8.png)
First, users should login. I used html, css and javascript to design a simple login website.

If users input a wrong username or password, they would see the above image.

When the users input the correct username and password, they can enter the invoice page and check
their own information.

when the users click the "add" button, they can add new information. After users input information,
the system would be updated automatically.

The users also are able to change their previous records if they click the "update" button.

In the end, the users also can remove unnecessary data if they click the "delete" button.

## Limitation

Due to limited time, this is a draft. I am going to polish this project, and I am glad to increase a number
of new features for example confirmations and messages when users delete or update their data.
